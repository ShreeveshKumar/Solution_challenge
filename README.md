# Greenscan Project

## Overview
Our project, Greenscan, is a comprehensive initiative aimed at promoting sustainable living by facilitating the identification and promotion of eco-friendly and carbon-neutral products. We've developed an innovative app, a user-friendly website, and a powerful machine learning (ML) module to enhance the eco-conscious shopping experience.
